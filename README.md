# PowerShell-Script-to-Securely-Provision-a-Batch-of-IoT-Devices

# BACKGROUND
Am I a PowerShell expert?  No.  However, I know how to use general-purpose LLMs to help me write code.  When an IT friend needed to finish a project quickly, I used ChatGPT to write the code to take a batch of IoT devices using their IP addresses and securely provisioning them using a password-protected SSL Certificate.  I was able to take a Bash command and run it in Powershell. The Powershell code accessed a CSV file that included IP addresses and automated the provisioning process by looping through the IP addresses and applying the setting to the IoT device.    

# INCLUDED IN THIS REPO
* CSV file with Sample IP addresses
* Fake SSL Certificate
* Curl Command (Command used inside of Powershell script)
* PowerShell IoT Device Script
* ChatGPT Prompt
